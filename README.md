Customer Analytics_Customer_Behavior

The importance of customer analytics is rising: because access to customer data became easier for many businesses, 
and also customers now have easier access to data and information on similar products and contents provided by other 
competitors, it is critical to many businesses to be able to understand and predict what their customers are likely to 
purchase or view. The deeper the understanding your company has about its customers, the better competitive power it will 
have against its competitors.
